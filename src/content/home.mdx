I’m a 16-year-old high school student from Morocco who loves building websites using React, Next.js, and more recently, Astro. I usually code in the terminal with <mark>Neovim</mark> on <mark>Arch Linux</mark>. I’ve learned <mark>Rust</mark> through the book and I'm looking for projects to improve my skills. and I'm most familiar with TypeScript.
