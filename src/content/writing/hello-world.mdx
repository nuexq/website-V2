## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's easy to write and can be converted to many formats, including HTML. Here's a quick test post to show the basics.

## Inline Code

You can use inline code like `console.log('Hello World!')` to highlight a small piece of code.

## Code Blocks

### JavaScript Code Example

Here’s a simple JavaScript function that says hello:

```ts
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Nuexq"));
```

### Shiki

```tsx
console.log("Introduction.");

console.log("Subtraction."); // [!code --]

console.log("Addition."); // [!code ++]

console.log("In highlight"); // [!code highlight]

console.log("End.");
```

## Links

You can add links to other resources like [GitHub](https://github.com) or [my personal website](https://nuexq.vercel.app).
