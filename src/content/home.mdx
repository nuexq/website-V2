Hey there! I'm a 16-year-old high school student from Morocco with a passion for learning. I’ve mainly worked with React, Next.js, and more recently, Astro for web development. I write most of my code in <mark>Neovim</mark> on my <mark>Arch Linux</mark> setup—check out my <a href={`${siteConfig.links.github}/dotfiles`}>dotfiles</a> if you're curious.

I’m most familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript, and right now I’m exploring Rust and systems programming. I also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin">Catppuccin</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://ctp-webr.ing/nuexq/previous">←</a> <a href="https://ctp-webr.ing/">webring</a> <a href="https://ctp-webr.ing/nuexq/next">→</a>.
