description: "Everything I've tried in 2024—games, TV shows, movies, books"

As 2024 ends, I wanted to reflect on everything I watched, played, and read throughout the year. It’s been a good year overall; I made significant improvements in front-end development. This year, I learned React and Next.js, and I dove into low-level programming. I also began learning Rust.

?> I've included here just things I've tried before 2025.

I didn't include anything I didn't complete, as well as open-ended games like **Minecraft** and **Stardew Valley**, which don’t have a definitive ending and just played it for chilling.

I'll be happy to hear your suggestions about what to try for the next year!
