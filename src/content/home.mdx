import { siteConfig } from "@/config/site";

Hi! I'm a 17-year-old student from Morocco with a passion for learning, especially about computers and code. My main focus has been web development using JavaScript/TypeScript with tools like React, Next.js, and more recently, Astro. I code in <mark>Neovim</mark> on ~~<mark>Arch Linux</mark>~~ <mark>NixOS</mark> btw â€“ you can check out my <a href={`${siteConfig.links.github}/nixos-config`}>NixOS config</a>.

Beyond web development, I'm currently exploring Rust and systems programming. I also contribute to [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).
