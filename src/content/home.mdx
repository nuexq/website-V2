import { siteConfig } from "@/config/site";

Hi! I'm a 16-year-old student from Morocco with a passion for learning, especially about computers and code. My main focus has been web development using JavaScript/TypeScript with tools like React, Next.js, and more recently, Astro. I code in <mark>Neovim</mark> on <mark>Arch Linux</mark> – you can check out my dotfiles <a href={`${siteConfig.links.github}/dotfiles`}>here</a>.

Beyond web development, I'm currently exploring Rust and systems programming. I also contribute to [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin), part of the <span class="whitespace-nowrap">[←](https://ctp-webr.ing/nuexq/previous) [webring](https://ctp-webr.ing/) [→](https://ctp-webr.ing/nuexq/next)</span>.
